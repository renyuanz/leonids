<div class="about">
  <img class="alignleft" src="/img/vic.png" width="20%"/>
<p style="text-align: left;"> By day I'm a software architect for <a href="http://www.solinea.com" target="_blank">Solinea</a>, the leading consulting and software provider enabling enterprises and service providers to accelerate the adoption of cloud computing. On this website I post blogs where I share code and system designs that I've used in the hope that they will help people with their own development projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For many years I did Linux system programming in C and C++. These days my technical infatuations include developing data search and analytics systems with <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and <a href="http://elastics.co" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I'm not slaving away over a hot keyboard - yes I do have a life outside technology - I like spending time with my family, cooking, going to theater and movies. My family and I are cat lovers and spend time <a href="#cats">fostering semi-feral cats for future adoption</a> - more on that later.</p>
<h4>My Blogging History</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back in 2011 I got started with blogging at Trend Micro when I wrote a blog on what to do <a href="http://fearlessweb.trendmicro.com/2011/smart-surfing/what-to-do-when-your-facebook-account-is-stolen/" target="_blank">when your Facebook account is stolen</a> for Trend Micro's internal facing employee social network. The blog was inspired by advice I gave to one of my son's high school teachers when that very thing happened to him. The folks at Fearless Web liked the piece enough to publish it on their website. A few blogs later they invited me to join the Fearless Web Team as one of their regular bloggers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the years I have written a considerable amount of software project documentation including: design specifications, functional requirements, engineering support training materials and software test set up tutorials. Many years ago I taught a course on Unix Network Programming for UC Berkeley Extension. Writing to explain how things work and are put together has always been a passion of mine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So shortly after I started blogging for Fearless Web, I decided to create my own personal blog, VicHargrave.com. My content is simliar to the type of documentation I've been writing for years. I blog mostly on programming and computer system topics that explain how to do things. My main programming languages are C, C++ and Java. Occasionally I'll post an article here on Internet security, although I do most of my security writing these days for Trend Micro <a title="Trend Micro Simply Security" href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/" target="_blank">Simply Security</a> and <a title="Trend Micro Simply Security" href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/" target="_blank">Security Intelligence</a>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a id="cats" name="cats"></a>Feral Cat Rehabilitation</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">My family and I are very much into cats. We have 4 of our own. We also work with <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/CA1681.html" target="_blank">Katydid Cat Rescue</a> to foster and help socialize cats that are rescued from the streets. Our goal is to help them feel comfortable being around people and eventually adopted by families that can give these beautiful animals the loving homes they deserve.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">How I Filter Comments and Pingbacks</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">I encourage those of you who are interested in my articles and have comments, to post them. I invite the feedback. I'll respond to any legitimate inquiry or discussion thread as long as it pertains to content on this site. Similarly with pingbacks. If your pingback truly points to this site then I'm fine with it. Otherwise pingbacks and comments unrelated to VicHargrave.com will be filtered.</p>
<h4>Free Stuff Licensing</h4>

However, I take no responsibility for its suitability or use as stated in the Apache License.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Helping You figure Stuff Out</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">I get a kick out of writing blogs to help people understand programming and share points of view on technology and other topics. I hope you find the information on this site interesting and useful.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks for visiting my website.</p>
