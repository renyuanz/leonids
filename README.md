### Update 03/08/2016
I'm working on making leonids a [jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) so that people can easily install the theme without having to fork or download anything from here. Actually the first gem version is published, you can install it by following the official [doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). You can find the rubygem version [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/leonids). But it will be on beta until I can finish the doc of how you can install leonids with the rubygem version.

### Update 05/06/2016

Important! It's better to download the gzipped files instead of forking the repo. I would really appreciate if you could give me a star. üòÅ
