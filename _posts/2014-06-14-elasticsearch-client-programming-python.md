<img class="image-left" src="/img/Elasticsearch-Python.png" width="150px"/>The [first article](/articles/2014-06/elasticsearch-client-programming-perl) in this two part series focused on developing Elasticsearch clients with Perl. Elasticsearch also has an excellent Python library which lets you search for and analyze your data with one of the many mathematics and machine learning libraries available for Python.

In this article I’ll cover how to create an Elasticsearch client using Python that has the same capabilities as the Perl client from the part 1 article.

### Got Anaconda Python?

There are many ways to get Python on your system, if you don’t have it already. It usually comes pre-installed on Linux systems. But I’ve developed a fondness for Anaconda Python provided by Continuum Analytics. Anaconda Python comes complete with a large set of libraries, including specialized machine learning modules such as NumPym, SciPy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, etc. Since I work with a machine learning group, I find this aspect of Anaconda Python particularly appealing. You can download Anaconda Python here.

### Install PyDev Plug-in for Eclipse

Even if you are an expert wth Python, I highly recommend writing your first Elasticsearch client using the Eclipse IDE, which has a Python development plug-in that helps you not only step through your code but also see how Elasticsearch JSON is mapped to Python data structures. If you don’t have a Perl environment for Eclipse then follow the steps in this section to install one.

The PyDev project produces a plug-in for Eclipse that provides assistance for Python development. You can install the plug-in by following these steps.

1. Select **Help > Install New Software…** from the Eclipse main menu.
2. Click on **Add** button to add the **Eclipse Perl Integration** update site.
3. Enter `PyDev and PyDev Extensions` in the name field.
   ![](/img/Add-PyDev-and-PyDev-Extensions.png)
4. Enter `hxxp://pydev.org/updates in the location` field.
5. Click on **OK**.
5. Click on the check box next to **PyDev**.

6. Click on the Finish button. Note the button in this illustration is greyed out since I have already installed the PyDev plug-in on my system, but for first installations the

To add the Elasticsearch client library for Python on either Linux, Windows or Mac OS, simply run pip as follows

{% highlight bash %}
pip install Elasticsearch
{% endhighlight %}

### Connecting to Elasticsearch

Let’s say we have an Elasticsearch cluster comprised of indices that contain data collected from Twitter’s 1% sample feed. The tweets are collected in a new index each day.  The format of the index name is `yyyy-mm-dd`. The server nodes that are exposed to clients is 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2 .

Now let’s do some programming. First create a new Perl project and client application file.

1. Select **File > New > Other…**
2. Enter the project name on the *Select Wizard* panel. Let’s call it `myPythonProject`.
3. Select **PyDev > PyDev** Project
4. Click on **Finish**.
5. Right click on the **Python** project in the *Navigation* panel then select **New > Other…**
6. Select **General > File**
7. Enter the file name on the S*elect Wizard* panel.  Let’s call it `tweet_search.py`.
8. Click on **Finish**.
9. Double click on `tweet_search.pl`, then start by entering the following code.

{% highlight python %}
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
import sys
import logging
 
logging.basicConfig()
 
es = Elasticsearch(['10.1.1.1:9200','10.1.1.2:9200'])
{% endhighlight %}

**Lines [1-5]** Import the Elasticsearch client as well as the sys and logging modules.

**Line [7]** Create an Elasticsearch client object. Specify the IP addresses and default Elasticsearch ports of the nodes to which the client will attempt to connect.

### Do an Elasticsearch Query

Tweets are structured in JSON format as specified in [Twitter’s documentation](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets). The fields that will be retrieved from Elasticsearch include the Twitter user ID string, the date the tweet was created and the expanded URL – after *unshortening* – that was sent in the text of the tweet. Let’s take a look how that data will appear in an index.

Here is a partial JSON structure that shows the placement of the tweet fields that will be included in each query response, namely the ID string of the user who sent the tweet, the date the tweet was created and the expanded URL that was sent in the text of the tweet.

{% highlight json %}
"coordinates": {},
"created_at": "2014-05-24T03:42:22.000Z",
"entities": {
    "hashtags": [],
    "urls": [
        {
            "url": "hxxp://t.co/9Bt38zRSMr",
            "display_url": "Grd5.com",
            "expanded_url": "hxxp://Grd5.com"
        }
     ],
     "user_mentions": [
        {
            "id": 868880934,
            "name": "whatever",
            "screen_name": "galatk123456"
        }
     ]
},
"favorite_count": 0,
  ...
"user": {
    "contributors_enabled": false,
    "created_at": "2012-10-08T23:48:20.000Z",
    "description": "whatever",
    "favourites_count": 327,
    "followers_count": 167,
    "friends_count": 280,
    "id_str": "868880934",
 
  ...
{% endhighlight %}

Looking at this tweet snippet you can see that these fields are referenced by the JSON names as: `user.id_str`, `created_at` and `entities.urls.expanded_url`.

The query in this example will involve two indices, `2014-04-12` and `2014-04-13`, looking for any expanded URL that comes from a Russian hosted domain (*.ru). To do the Elasticsearch client `search()` method is called as follows.

{% highlight python linenos %}
rs = es.search(index=['tweets-2014-04-12','tweets-2014-04-13'], 
               scroll='60s', 
               search_type='scan', 
               size=100, 
               body={
                 "fields" : ["created_at", "entities.urls.expanded_url", "user.id_str"],
                   "query" : {
                     "wildcard" : { "entities.urls.expanded_url" : "*.ru" }
                   }
               }
           )
{% endhighlight %}

**[Lines 1-4]** One or more indices are specified in the index field which is an array of strings. The inclusion of the scroll and size fields creates what amounts to a cursor that indicates how many seconds Elasticsearch should cache results to be scrolled through and how many results are returned by each scroll operation, `100` tweets at a time in this case. Specifying search_type as `scan` disables sorting of search results to improve the efficiency of scrolling through result sets.

**[Lines 5-10]** The type of query and fields involved are specified in the body field. The fields array includes the tweet fields that we want in the query response. The query does a wildcard search for expanded URLs that contain the characters `*.ru`.

### Retrieve the Query Results

The query results are retrieved `100` tweets at a time by successive calls to `scroll()` using the scroll ID returned from the original query.

{% highlight python linenos %}
tweets = []
scroll_size = rs['hits']['total']
while (scroll_size > 0):
    try:
        scroll_id = rs['_scroll_id']
        rs = es.scroll(scroll_id=scroll_id, scroll='60s')
        tweets += rs['hits']['hits']
        scroll_size = len(rs['hits']['hits'])
    except: 
        break
{% endhighlight %}

**[Lines 1-2]** Create an array to hold all the retrieve tweets then retrieve successive sets of tweets in a while loop. Then set the `scroll_size` variable that will track the number of records returned during each scan loop. To start off `scroll_size` is set to the total number of documents that will be returned.

**[Lines 3]** While loop that gets the number of documents specified in the first search() call each time through. The while loop continues until `scroll_size` goes to `0`.

**[Lines 4-7]** The scroll ID can change from scan to scan, so set the ID for subsequent scrolls to the one returned by the previous `search()` or `scroll()` call. Each time through the loop, the search results are returned in the `rs['hits']['hits]` array which is appended to the tweets array.

**[Line 8]** Update the `scroll_size` variable to the number of tweets returned. When the scanning is done, `scroll()` returns `0`.

**[Line 9-10]** Catch any exceptions then break.

### Display the Query Results

All that’s left to do is display the entire set of tweets returned. For queries where certain fields are specified, Elasticsearch conveniently returns just the fields specified, placing them in a JSON section labeled `fields` as shown here.

{% highlight json %}
"hits": {
   "hits": [
      {
         "_index": "tweets-2014-04-12",
         "_type": "status",
         "_id": "470047633969782784",
         "_score": 1,
            "fields": {
               "user.id_str": [
                  "2481821394"
               ],
               "created_at": [
                  "2014-05-24T03:44:23.000Z"
               ],
               "entities.urls.expanded_url": [
                  "hxxp://www.zzzz.ru/top-ehnergetiki/2013-07-26-55"
               ]
            }
      },
...
{% endhighlight %}

To display the tweet fields, just loop through the `tweets` array referencing the returned fields as shown here.

{% highlight python %}
for tweet in tweets:
    print tweet['_id'], tweet['fields']['user.id_str'], 
    tweet['fields']['created_at'],
    tweet['fields']['entities.urls.expanded_url']
{% endhighlight %}

Using this client program you can experiment with other types of queries by simply changing the fields and body field contents.
