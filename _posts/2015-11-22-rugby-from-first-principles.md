Rugby Union is a great game to play and watch, but if you don't know the rules it looks like chaos. Trying to understand the rules based on what you see on TV can be quite hard since the core principle of rugby and the game theory that emerges from the rules forces players to go through seemingly strange rituals. Why are people being lifted into the air and why must the ball be passed backwards? These questions and many more I try to answer in this post by deriving a core principle of the game. Supposedly rugby was birthed through some rouge soccer players who decide to just pick up the ball and run with it. Maybe that is true, but I think there are still a deeper principle that you rely on to explain the game in a logical way. Throughout this post most example clips come from one excellent game of rugby played between Australia and New Zealand in 2014 but occasionally I have to use some pieces from other matches. If you already know a fair bit about rugby, you can probably just skip the clips. I tried to be minimalist in explaining the rules so if you are new to rugby this will be enough to probably make a game watchable but you will still come across a lot of referee whistles that don't make sense.

### The Core Principle - Marching right through your opponent

The goal of Rugby is to get the ball from your half of the field, past the *try line* guarded by the other team, and place the ball on the ground. The try lines are spanned by 100 m and there are goal posts at the center of each try line. Here is a clip of the Wallabies (Australia's national team) scoring a try against a series of tackles.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Gj_W8Rsoy4?start=2592&end=2604" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

At the core of the game, Rugby is about moving your body from one end of the field to the other while the opposition tries to stop you with all the physical force they have. This principle is so simple it does not even require a ball. The ball is required to thread together the effort of players on a team and provide continuity between isolated attempts at fulfilling this primary goal. Note that this idea of piecing together shards of effort is honoured since tackles are only legally made on the ball carrier. If you were the only player, in a theoretical version of rugby which did not involve a ball, you could be tackled as the principle implies. But if we add the ball, then the only work that matters is the work by the player with the ball and so defence is only allowed to tackle that player.

So let's now add the ball to the equation and say instead of just getting a body from A to B we must get the ball from A to B. Now, it would be a very different game if you could just send one person to the opposition end of the field and have them catch a ball you lob to them from far away. In that scenario there is nothing about you marching forward on your feet and the opposition trying to forcefully stop you. To reconcile the core principle and the fact that we are now using the position of a ball as a proxy for the position of *a* body, a few rules are added.

##### You cannot pass forwards
Forcing you to pass backwards means that any ground you gain must be made by you running forward either around or through defenders. Everytime you pass you sacrifice a bit of ground to get the ball to another player and the next ball carrier must make up that distance (and hopefully more) by marching forward on their feet. This passing backwards rule gives us the most classic rugby sequence - just passing the ball from player to player as everyone is running forward.

##### Kicking
While passing is strictly backwards, kicking is allowed in the forward direction provided you satisfy some conditions which ensure you only gain distance equal your body's ability to get through the opposition's line of defence. Kicking is used in different scenarios but for now, just know that if you are not physically carrying the ball you cannot be tackled and so kicking the ball allows you to get the ball out of your hands and prevent the opposition from tackling you. Again, the easiest way to explain how kicks work with this core principle is to start with a principled unrealistic scenario and then rules are worked in to make the game more playable/enjoyable.

Imagine that the rules say that you are only allowed to kick to yourself. Take the scenario that you are running into a line of defence, you decide that you are likely to be tackled and you have no one to pass the ball to. In that scenario your only option is to kick the ball over the opposition line, run forward and try to catch the ball behind enemy lines. Every meter that could possibly have been gained from this maneuver would have been equal to the distance you ran - you cannot catch the ball at some location you didn't run to. Since you cannot be tackled while the ball is in the air, it seems like you are cheating the original principle since you can just run past defenders who cannot touch you. The flip side is that kicking the ball directly into opposition territory is very risky since you are basically just kicking the ball to the other team. The position known as the *full-back* (#15) has a responsibility to look out for and catch kicks over the top of the defensive line. This is an example of doing a *chip and chase* kick to yourself.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFAOHJSY8JM?start=50&end=66" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Now, the rules don't say that you have to kick to yourself. You are allowed to kick to other team members if you satisfy one of the two conditions:

1. The player who catches the ball was behind you at the time you kicked it. Other wise you are off-side.
1. The player who catches the ball is behind you at the time they catch it. So if they are ahead of you when you kick the ball you might run forward to put your team member back on-side since the meters you just ran are going to be more than is gained by kicking the ball.

So this, in a hand wavy way, is how kicks are worked into the game while maintaining the core principle.

### Team Structure and Running with the Ball

The rest of the sections are about all the weird things you see rugby players doing on the field. Before I explain those, I need to explain a bit more about the team structures. In a rugby team, there are two *packs.* The *forwards* which comprise players number 1 through 8 and the *backs* which comprise numbers 9 through 15. The *forwards'* primary job is to secure the ball at the *breakdown* (formed when someone gets tackled) and the *backs* are supposed to make distance forward with skilled passes, high speed and agility. To understand how ball running and tackling works, see this clip here.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Gj_W8Rsoy4?start=4242&end=4290" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Notice how when a player got tackled, a bunch of other players (usually forwards) pile on top of him. This is because the rules state that when your knees hit the ground, you are no longer standing and so you must release the ball from you hands. When not standing, you are not allowed to just death grip the ball so that the other team cannot get it - that would give the other team a penalty. This is inline with the core principle since once you have been tackled, you have effectively been defeated in your goal to get to the other end of the field with your own dexterity and strength.

The core principle could have been that you must get from A to B no matter how bad your situation, even if you are pinned to the ground, but at that point you have wrestling which is a completely different sport. So the only fair way to continue play since there are many people in each team is for you to release the ball and now the ball is free to grab.

Upon getting tackled and falling to the ground you don't need to just let go of the ball as if it was going to explode, typically you will place it towards your team in a controlled manner so that another one of your team mates can pick it up and run with it (you saw that in the clip above). Even if you were to just place a ball towards your team though, the opposition can take it very quickly. To stop the opposition poaching the ball, the forwards are supposed to secure the ball that was released by the tackled player by building a physical barricade around it. There are then a set of rules which ensure that you do not go around one of these human barricades but the only way to steal possession is to force your way through (again thinking of the core principle). Upon tackle, or any breakdown, the forwards immediately swoop in and secure the ball so the opposition cannot just take it. Forwards do spend some time trying to drive the ball forward although usually those are small simple charges directly ahead.

Ten minutes into rugby match, the forwards are usually covered in mud however the *backs* will remain clean for most of the game. That is because they focus on moving the ball forward through passing and stepping around defenders. Only in emergency situations, when no other forwards are around to help, will a back be involved in securing the breakdown. When backs are executing a play, they typically form an oblique line (seen in the second clip of this blog post) so that they are always behind the player which currently has the ball and therefore are in a valid position to receive a pass. The half-back (#9) is a special position because they are responsible for getting the ball from the forwards to the backs. The half-back is usually the one to pick the ball up at every breakdown and they can then choose to pass the ball to more forwards for quick drives ahead or pass it to the flyhalf (#10) to begin a backs play. Here is an amazing play from the New Zealand backs in 2000.

### Play Structures

##### The Ruck

The *breakdown* that is described above may turn into a *ruck* if there is actually a contest for the ball rather than a team instantly sealing over the ball in a way that is impenetrable. The first player to get to the breakdown (the tackler, if not on his feet, does not count) is allowed to use his hands to pick up the ball for two reasons.
1. The ruck has not formed yet and so there is no contest of bodily force yet.
1. As discussed above, the ball cannot be held by a player not their feet since they have individually been defeated in their attempt to move their body forwards and that defeat can be symbolised by allowing the opposition to pick up the ball and starting moving it in the opposite direction.

If players from opposing teams get to the breakdown at the same time there will be a contest over the ball and only when the contest has been *clearly won* can a player legally pick up the ball and claim possession. If timing was exact, the situation you would get would be two opposing players trying to drive each other back such that where they contact each other is directly over the ball. We could call this the 50-50% position to indicate that both players have equal claim to the ball at this point. To *clearly win* the contest you are required to drive the opposition players back away from the ball such that what is directly over the ball are players from your side, not some mix of players like describe in the 50-50% position.

So most rucks are a contest for territory and so players will push against each other to fight for ground. The second thing you can do apart from move your body over the ball is move the ball under your body using your feet (this is *rucking* the ball). Once the players bound to the ruck have moved over the ball and the contest has clearly been won, the half-back (or really any player) can pick up the ball and resume play.

Here are 2 example rucks. It was actually quite hard to get good clips of interesting rucks so I had to just pull them from a tribute video for David Pocock, an amazing Wallabee which became famous through his ability to win rucks.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FG6IwlFfLmU?start=257&end=266" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

##### The Scrum
A scrum is a perfect ruck. You have all 8 forwards from each team, in a perfect 3-4-1 structure and they contest for position over the ball. The scrum was invented as a mechanism to resume play. The continuity of rugby is not meant to be broken but if a foul occurs (like passing the ball forward) something is needed restart play and a ruck represents a possible scenario of play, that being a tackle which turns into some sort of massive ruck. The backs are then able to use a large empty field for some spectacular plays. Before I explain more, just get an idea of what happens in a scrum and look for the half-back (#9) who feeds the ball into the scrum.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Gj_W8Rsoy4?start=3406&end=3441" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

In a scrum, there is an imbalance of power since one team gets to feed the ball in and they will feed it towards their own pack. As expected, the team which did not foul is the one with the advantage but that advantage is not complete superiority over the ball. There is still a contest that occurs and some chance (be it low) for the other team to get the ball. Here is an example of Argentina winning a scrum *against the feed* with South Africa as the opposition.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xakKz4dwF0Q?start=27" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

##### The Maul

The *maul* is a sibling to the ruck. It is a contest for the ball but the ball is held by a player rather than being on the ground. Either by deliberate construction or when a player gets tackled but manages to stay on their feet, we have a *maul*. Fellow team mates will bind to the ball carrier to drive them forward through the opposition defense which is pushing in the other direction. Here is a clip of a short maul that is constructed from a lineout.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Gj_W8Rsoy4?start=5075&end=5098" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

If the maul is stationary for 5 seconds or more the referee will blow the whistle, declare the maul *held up* and game play is resumed with a *scrum* (to be explained later) with the defending side in position of the ball. Why does stalling for 5 seconds result in a turnover of posetion? Thinking back to the core principle - if the defence manages to stop your maul dead in its tracks, they have effectively defeated your attempt to get to their try line. Typically, if a maul is moving forward and it stops, the team in possession will rapidly try to get the ball out of the maul and back into play, probably with a backs run since a maul usually black-holes a lot of forwards.

##### Lineout
This is also a mechanism to resume play, and again there is a contest with a power imbalance. A lineout occurs when a ball goes out of bounds (called going *into touch*) and you can think of it like a *throw in* in soccer. Take a look at successful lineouts here.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Gj_W8Rsoy4?start=1375&end=1407" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Gj_W8Rsoy4?start=5073&end=5088" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

So some weird stuff is happening with people talking and going into the air at different times. There are no rules saying *"thou shall lift thy fellow team mate via the leg at some randomly chosen time"* or anything like that. The lineout is actually quite simple. A particular forward, knows as the *hooker* (#2), must throw the ball at least 5 meters back into the field along a line that is perpendicular to the touch line. No players can be directly on this perpendicular line but they can stand on either side of it. The perpendicular rule is to ensure some sort of fair contest to catch the ball because otherwise the hooker would just thrown the ball directly into the territory controlled by his team. The 5 meter rule is to stop the hooker just handing the ball to a teammate within arms reach. With players on either side of the line and the hooker throwing, the two sides can compete for the inbound ball.

Although there is a contest, there is a fair imbalance of power to favour the team which did not put the ball into touch. This team is the one throwing the ball and so they can coordinate secretly about how deep and how high the ball will go. To do this the hooker or some player will usually shout out some random words which only they understand. When I played rugby we would say something like *"34, Heineken, sting."* The number at the front would specify the depth of the throw by encoding single digit numbers as the front of the line, double digits as the middle and three digit numbers as the back. The beer that came second would indicate if we were going to pass the ball to the backs or just have the forwards construct a maul. We would tell the two apart based on if the beer was international or not (relative to Australia). And usually we just said something random on the end to taunt the other team or there might have been a special word or two reserved for special plays.

So being able to throw the ball the way you want it and communicate some information to your team mates are the advantage of the team throwing in. The degrees of freedom which this can influence are the timing and trajectory (height and distance of the arc). In order to contest the ball as it travels through the air the opposition has to guess where the ball is going. The more possible outcomes there are the harder it will be for them to guess and the larger the advantage the possessing team has against them. Originally, the lineouts did not have any lifting but people would just jump for the ball. Then lifting became a way to put the ball somewhere which is very hard to contest. It also increases the outcome spaces (since the height range is much larger now) and makes it harder for the opposition to guess where the ball is going. Inbounding teams got smarter and started using tricks like fake jumps. It's pretty hard to actually steal the ball but with lifts and more variability in the lineout, there is a high chance of screwing everything up. Most of the time that the opposition win the lineout, the inbounding team just messes it up and tries to be too fancy.

Lineout is stolen by defence (All Blacks) which contest and manage to knock the ball to their side.

Lineout without lift - notice the ball is clearly thrown right over the perpendicular line but it was so unusual to not lift that Australia didn't even have time to contest the ball.

### Go watch/play

So that covers all the major pieces of a Rugby game. There are a lot of other things like penalty kicks, field goals, more detailed rules about everything I have mentioned etc. This post just attempts to demystify some strange events in rugby. I hope that now the game is more enjoyable for you and if you have clarifications you would like to add to this post, comment below and I will try to include them.
