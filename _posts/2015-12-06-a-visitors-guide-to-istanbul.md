French Baroque style architecture + breath taking mosques + birth of chrisianiti, bible created ... 

Istanbul is an amazing city and everyone should visit it. It is a mix of European, Middle Eastern and Asian culture all in one. I don't know if any land has been fought over more than the straights of the Hellespont (Dardanelles) and the Bosphorus which splits Istanbul in the middle. Going backwards in time, you have the battle of Gallipoli in WWI, Byzantine-Ottoman wars which resulted in the fall of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Greco-Persian wars with Xerxes himself, who had the  (yes the actual water) whipped 300 times because a storm destroyed the pontoon he built on it and finally, the legend of Troy.

If you go to Turkey, you can spend most of your time in Istanbul but I do recommend spending at least one day and night to Cappadocia which is in the middle of Turkey. Out there there are some amazing geological structures (fairy Chimneys), churches dating back to the birth of Christianity and the best hot air ballooning experience in the world. I also love the landscape out in the North East Black Sea region if you have extra time.

Istanbul is made up of three parts. [[[link]]] The old city is the oldest part where the centre of action has historically been. The *European side* is the most modern part and the *Asian side* doesn't have too much on it for a toursit.

Before 1453, Istanbul was Constantinople. Prior to that name it was called Byzantium because it was the capital of the Byzantine empire. Emperor Constantine the Great renamed it after himself. Now, the Byzantine empire is nothing more than the East Roman Empire. At this point time, the Romans had swept through everything from Italy and past Greece. Constantinople then became the pinnacle of civilization and wealth. It had aqueducts better than London in the 19th century, the first public hospitals were here and this is also where the Bible was put together. It is also still the center of the Greek orthodox church, the Armenian orthodox church and because of the Spanish expulsion of Jews in 1492, there is also a small representation of Jews still in Istanbul. The Ottomans warmly welcomed the exiled Jews because they had great economic impetus and skills.

The Ottomans were initial a group of Central Asian Turkic tribes. One leader, Osman, convinced all the tribes to follow him and basically used this new army to conquer everything West of central Asia.  He was the first Ottoman Sultan and started an empire that would last 800 years and dominate everything from today's Middle East right up to the gates of Vienna.

The Ottomans worked their way westwards moving their capital each time they took a new Roman city. Their largest prize was Constantinople. They had seen the glory there - the wealth and and amazing paradise it was. Sultan Mehmet II the Conqueror, at age 21, lead the Ottoman armies towards Constantinople and besieged the city. The siege actually started in Mehmet's father's time who built a small fortress just upstream of Constantinople on the Asian side. This was to cut off the Romans' access to the Black Sea. Mehmet cut off access to the Black Sea even more by building a massive fortress filled with cannons on the European side. It is  called Rümeli Hisarı and I hope you visit it when you are there. From there you can see the smaller fortress across the water. With the crossfire of cannons provided by these two structures no ships could pass.

There is a body of water called the Golden Horn (see the map) which the Romans had blocked off with a very large iron chain. They anchored it to each shore and let it sit about 2 ft. under water. This would prevent any war ship from passing which was important because the walls on that side of Constantinople were less fortified. Mehmet decided one night, *stuff the chain*, and got his men to pick up the small boats and cannons, walk them over the land of the European side and put them in the Golden Horn. The Romans work up to see Ottoman cannons being fired at them on their weakest side. Mehmet told his men that if they took the city that day he would let them have the city to themselves for 3 days. They were allowed to sack and pillage everything except for the Roman palace and religious buildings. This motivation worked and on May 29, 1453 Constantinople fell and was named Istanbul.

The Byzantine's largest church, probably the largest in the world at this point, was the Hagia Sophia. This translates to *Divine Wisdom*. When you visit it, you will see it is more mosque looking. This is because it was converted into a mosque. The Ottomans loved to do this. You will notice mosques everywhere you walk. They have large minarets (circular pointy towers) with speakers on them to sound the call to prayer which you will hear 4-5 times a day depending on whether or not the first one wakes you up. Many of the mosques are magnificent. If you walk by one and you want to visit, you can and you should. Provided it is not prayer time the mosque will be open. Just take off your shoes and walk in. You should probably have long pants on and if you are female, you must wear a Hijab (head scarf). You do not need to be practiced at wear it, just attempt.

So, Mehmet later made Istanbul the political and economic center of the empire. He forced people to moved there and all the trade routes, most importantly the silk road between Asia and Europe,  went through the city. As always, the Ottoman Empire was focused on the next thing to conquer. Their entire empire was actually built on conquest and many scholars say their decline occurred right when they started losing battles. I believe a contributing factor to their losses was their clinging to traditional ways and being slow to take up new weaponry/tactics. They did not stop with Istanbul of course. They tried to takes Vienna twice but failed both times. Had they succeeded, it is likely that a huge amount of Europe would have been under Ottoman control and would be more Muslim than Christian today.

During the 18th and 19th century, the influence of every growing Europe got stronger. Eveidence of this can be seen in the difference in architectures between Topkapı Palace (first Ottoman palace in Istanbul from 1465-1856) and Dolmabahçe Palace (1856-1922). Topkapı is completely Ottoman while Dolmabahçe looks like something from the ceneter of Paris. Finally, the Ottoman empire falls and Mustafa Kemal Ataturk creates modern Turkey. At the end of WWI, when the British, French and predominantely, the Greek, attempt to occupy Turkey, Ataturk manages to take the remains of the military and beat the foreign forces out of the country. In the modern era, Istanbul has been going through explosive growth. 10 years ago there were none of the skyscrapers you will see in some areas.

That is a very breif history. The itinerary will give you all the things you must see as well as some hidden things which I think are really cool. A lot of the sites will relate to the story I told you above. You will see some incredible history before your eyes in this city. A history which had a massive lasting impact on the world today.

So, I will just give a list of things and what should be done sequentially due to proximity. Since you may be going out of Istanbul for a day I leave it to you to decided when to do which blocks.

Oh, and transport. Each of you should by an "Istanbul Card" (or you could get one communal one) when you get there. They cost like maybe 5 Turkish Lira ($2 USD) and then you can load them up with money where you buy them, at train stations or some big bus/trap stops. This card can do everything. ferry, bus, metro, tram, metro-bus (buses with dedicated roads), and a few other things.

Also I’ll say a bit about food/drink here so that you know what to look for on the way:
Make sure you have lots of Baklava. I have now had Baklava from random Western countries and also Greece, Turkey, the West Bank, Israel, Iran, Tunisia and Bulgaria. By far the best one is Turkish. East Lots! The best brand is Güllüoglu.
Turks are ALWAYS drinking tea. Ask for Çay [pronounced Chai] after/before/during every meal. Its great.
Turkish coffee is also great. (You just drink the top bit and not the grounds.) When you ask for coffee they will ask you how you want it. Three options (which I will give you phonetically) - Share-kair-le (with sugar), Or-ta (normal, a bit of sugar), Sa-de (no sugar). Beware, Turkish coffee is very strong. 
Kebab/Shawarma (they call it döner [duh-ner]) - now I am a vegetarian but for those of you who are not I do advise you to try it. Turks are very proud of their Kebab and there are many types. The best is in Sultanahmet (tram stop) area.
Have lots of soup. Turks have soup with almost every meal and they are really good. Try to get Mercimek [pronounced "Mer-ji-mek"] soup which is the standard lentil soup.
Find a breakfast dish called Menemen. Essentially an omelette casseroleç
Have çiğ köfte [pronounced "Chi köfte" - that 'ö' character sounds like the "i" in "Irwin"] - so this dish you will see everywhere. It was traditionally raw meat that they put into wraps with lettuce, tomatoes and sauce. A while ago the health ministry banned serving raw meat (for obvious reasons) and so now the meat looking stuff is made purely from cracked wheat. Its really good!
Have this food with "Ayran" [pronounced "I-Ran"]. Ayran is a salty fluid yoghurt based drink. Somewhat like a salty lassi. Definitely not everyone likes it - but you should try. I was addicted.
Have rice with chickpeas. Simple but excellent in Turkey.
You will find lots of little Börek (pastry with cheese, spinach, meat) - those make excellent snacks.
"Simit" are salty loops of bread loaded with sesame seeds. those are great for a snack too. In Sultanahmet you can get them with Nutella!
There best chain cafe is called "Simit Sarayi" (means Palace of Simit) and they have lots of good stuff. You will see them everywhere. I believe one is soon to open up in New York actually!
Lots of random fruit juice sellers around which squeeze in front of you. Those are great for quick hydration. Don't pay anything about 4 lira for a cup. In Taksim/Istiklal don't even bother.




Blocks:

NOT ON SUNDAY --> The Old City: (where you explore part 1. Should be doable in 1 day because almost of all of it is next to each other.)
(Use the tram to get here if you are on the European side.)

First points 2-6 are all in definitely in walking distance

Starting this morning could be done in 2 ways. From your hotel directly to point 1 (or 2) or making a trek out to St. Savior in Chora, Aka the "Chora Church." This one is a bit hard to get but I do highly recommend it. Very old Byzantine church and it has, without doubt, the best mosaics I have ever seen. Take the tram to Yusufpaşa tram top and then walk north just a bit to Aksarayi metro stop. Then take the metro up one stop to Topkapı-Ulubatlı stop. From here just taxi. After this you can just head back the way you came and begin at point 2 by getting off at Sultanahmet tram station.
Spice bazaar (I would only do this if you were coming from the EU side by tram. Stop at Eminönü station, check it out, get back on tram and continue)
Blue Mosque (Stop at Sultanahmet station) - this is one of the most amazing mosques you will see. Very strange because it has 6 minarets. Fun fact: any mosque in Istanbul was only allowed to have more than one minaret if it was commissioned by a royal. The Blue Mosque was designed by famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan.
Roman Hippodrome (just beside Blue Mosque)- This was a race track for Roman entertainment. Probably also used for gladiator battle too. There is not much to see here today but you can see where it would have been. It is marked out by a random Iron pillar (shot one night by a drunken Diplomat - hence the holes), a massive Obelisk from Egypt (that thing is actually 1/3 the original size!) and another tall thing.
Hagia Sophia - the one I mentioned from above.
Basilica Cistern - This is totally random but awesome. It was a massive underground reservoir for water built by the Byzantines. This was also where a scene from James Bond film From Russia with Love was filmed. Down there you will see 2 heads of Medusa used as nothing more than a big rock for structural support.
Topkapı Palace - This was the first (of 6) palaces which were built by the Ottomans after the conquest. It is a massive complex. They have a cool display of Ottoman weapons. You can still see the Harem (from where the Sultan's wives and concubines would come) and the room where they discussed imperial policy and strategy. At first the Sultans would be there for these cabinet meetings but then they got board of politics. During meetings the Sultan would sit in a room just above the meeting room with a grating (you can see the grating) between them. He would listen there and only call the Grand Vizier if he felt something not to his liking was about to happen.
If you feel you have time, check out the Archaeology Museum just next to Dolmabache. Its pretty sick. Although keep in mind the Grand Bazaar is basically shut after 7 pm so judge how much time you want there. (Also be-careful because the Grand Bazaar is closed on Sunday.)
---------------------------------> tram or walk to Grand Bazaar
Grand Bazaar (Beyazıt station) - also used for the opening scene of Skyfall. It is massive. If you buy, definitely bargain A LOT. It is still the original structure that they used in the Ottoman period. This was a pinnacle point for a hell of a lot of trade between Europe and the Middle East/Asia for a long long time.

Ok so, day 2.
The New City: (exploring part 2)
Taksim and Istiklal Street. - I would advise you to start here and then come back at night. It is the absolute focal point of Istanbul and it has a different vibe in the day and in the night. Now I know some people say that their city never sleeps. Wally, you probably do. Believe me, in comparison to Istiklal street, New York is always asleep. So Taksim is the big square at the top of the street (there is a metro stop here, or if you are at Kabataş tram stop you can use the "Funicular" to get there. (A Funicular is like a 1D train which just goes up and down hill usually pulled by cable.) From the square you can walk down Istiklal street (Istiklal means Independence in Turkish) and merge into the crowd of people which probably represent every single nationality on the earth. The street is long so you can walk for a while. As you walk down be sure to enter the "Pasajs" (passages) which run off both left and right. Each pasaj tends to have a different theme. They are great to explore. If you find yourself in one with fish/sea food you are in a good area for Restaurants. Try to find a "Mehane" which is a traditional Turkish restaurant where you will have Meze (basically Tapas) and Raki (basically Öuzo/Pastis/Arak/Richard/ like any other aniseed flavoured fermented grape) You have Raki with water. Probabs 1:5 Raki:Water ratio. About half way you will find a Shake Shack - obviously that is good.
Now just a warning with Taksim/Istiklal: almost every time there is political turmoil there are protests in this area. Just keep a watch on the news. If there are protests then I wouldn't go there. If there is a protest there is a very high chance the police use the TOMA (water canons) and release tear gas. But if you're a Rambo, then screw the police and join in! (Hersh, I expect you to take on the water cannon for the team)
Dolmabache Palace - building this palace basically bankrupt the entire empire. It looks completely French because this was a time of great cultural import for the Ottomans. It is home to the most and 4th most large Bohemian chandeliers in the world (the largest weighs 4 tonnes and was given as a present by Queen Victoria). This is where Ataturk died actually and all the clocks inside are set to the time of his death. Take a tour - its totally amazing.
Naval museum (Deniz Müzesi) - full of many old Ottoman war ships. Right next to Dolmabache. Just upstream.
From here you can, if you like, head on to the Istanbul Modern museum. Its quite good if you are into art. Its about 20 min downstream just sticking along the waterfront. Easy to miss though. Keep an eye out for signs.
Military museum (get here by taking the Metro to Osmanbey and walking South just 5 minutes.) It has an incredible collection. Highly recommend!

Day 3 - I left this day shorter because I assume you have some of you own exploration to add in or what not.
Both of these places are in the north part of the European side - a bit far from all the other places I have mentioned.
Borusan Museum (although this can only be on a Saturday or Sunday). The Borusan museum is really cool and very underground. It is just a building (which looks something like a fairytale castle) which is now an office space for the Borusan group. The cool thing is that its the coolest office space I have ever seen and on the weekends it is open like a museum. It is loaded with cool pieces of art and just an innovative atmosphere. The issue with this though is that it is pretty far. You will need to take the Metro out to Levent station. From there I would just take a taxi. With the lot of you split up that will be cheap. This office block is in a very nice part of Istanbul. Pretty much the richest part.
While you are in this area you can visit Rümeli Hisarı which I mentioned before. Again, just ask for a Taxi or from the Borusan it is a nice walk downstream along the shore line. When you see a big castle thing with large cylindrical cannon towers - that is it.

Hope you all enjoy it.
While you are there message me with any questions you have.
You will probably see some super random stuff there that you don’t understand. I would like to explain if I can.

Peace yall,
Julian.
